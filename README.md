# Multilayer-Perceptron
Artificial neurons represent the building blocks of the multilayer artificial neural networks. The basic concept behind artificial neural networks was built upon hypotheses and models of
how the human brain works to solve complex problem tasks. Although artificial neural networks have gained a lot of popularity in recent years, 
early studies of neural networks go back to the 1940s when Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitt first described how neurons could work.
